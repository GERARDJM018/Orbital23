# Zenith

Zenith is essentially a self-improvement application with built-in gamification elements which reward students for doing productive activities. Zenith helps users not only schedule their assignments and study schedule rationally but also consider their mental state by giving the users tips related to mental health as well as productivity. With the gamification feature, Zenith is able to track and use the data of the students to analyze their lifestyles. By providing a range of features that support emotional resilience and healthy habits, the application helps students build the skills and strategies they need to thrive both personally and academically.
